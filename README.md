## About

A game where you're a moth in a world where no ambient gravity exists. Instead, light pushes you away just as much as your moth brain is attracted to it.

## Community

I'm making this game as a passion project with my friends. Shout out to the Tekton lunch squad for inspiring me with the initial idea/concept of a world where light = gravity.
