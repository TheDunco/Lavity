- [ ] Mobile builds
	- [ ] Need to consider mobile control scheme
	- [ ] A11y work in general
- [x] Items: **The mechanics of the items should be that they're floating Lavity lights that you slowly have to push around to absorb their powers and that affects the color of your player light. Certain enemies could be attracted to certain types of light! THIS IS THE GAME!**
- [x] Make a Hero Text system to display objectives, goals, challenges, and messages like winning
- [x] Make ColorPassableArea work for motes instead of the player light now that we have scrolling
- [ ] Add enemies to maze that try to fight you for the limited light available
	- [x] Lanternfly
	- [ ] Doppelganger: looks like and follows the player, must repulse to get it further away (always goes to the minimum distance to the player and when the player moves away that gets closer. Resets on repulse).
	- [ ] Lightning bug: gains light instead of losing it, food for maze
	- [ ] Frog/Toad/Lizard (eats all bug types)
	- [ ] Spider (w/ web)
	- [ ] Venus Fly Trap that spawns motes to lure bug types in
	- [ ] Rhino beetle (maze boss that crawls in/on the walls)
- [ ] When enemies die, they pop and release motes of the color they were
- [ ] Make the edges of the maze light up for easier visibility
- [ ] Items/Power Ups/Rewards for progression
	- [ ] Something that lets you set you color so it doesn't change unless you scroll
	- [ ] Something that lets you avoid the stealth cutoff
